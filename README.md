A person who has a reckless dream but achieves a very realistic goal.

My goal is to set up a software company that people around the world can use and dream of having wealth and good influence through it, and to start a journey toward dreams by starting a company within five years.

Currently, I work as a back-end developer at a startup in the pre-A stage, and I am interested in creating technically better products and organizing culture to achieve the best results.

### Experiences & Interest
