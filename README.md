[I started coding out of curiosity about the software](https://joonfluence.tistory.com/entry/%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%98%EB%A8%B8%EC%9D%98-%EA%B8%B8%EC%9D%84-%EA%B1%B7%EA%B2%8C-%EB%90%9C-%EA%B3%84%EA%B8%B0).
I'm a programmer who thinks "work for others is work for myself.
I like to grow up with my team members and like to share development-related articles on [blog](https://joonfluence.tistory.com/).
I never let go of development in my daily life or in my company, and I constantly learn to [leap to the level of an engineer](https://joonfluence.tistory.com/entry/%EC%86%8C%ED%94%84%ED%8A%B8%EC%9B%A8%EC%96%B4%EB%B6%84%EC%95%BC-%EC%A0%84%EB%AC%B8%EC%84%B1%EC%9D%84-%ED%82%A4%EC%9A%B0%EA%B8%B0-%EC%9C%84%ED%95%9C-%EB%85%B8%EB%A0%A5%EB%93%A4).
And i have a dream founding a company which provide a software to almost everyone in the world. Directly or indirectly. I will found a software company in 5 years, and accomplish my dream in 10 years. You can contact me contact me via [facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100032717027973), Always welcome to talking about development and software business.
